Step4:Sort the data by GDP and present the top 20 data items

Step5:Show the simple statistical information (mean, std, min, max, quartile1, quartile2, quartile3)

Step6:Plot the distribution of two class (1. GDP < 58000, 2. GDP >= 58000) of COVID-19 State Data using different colors and different marker where x-axis is the Pollution and y-axis the Mortality-rate.

Step7:Show the proportion of three class of COVID-19 State Data using pie chart. About the class:

1、 Mortality-rate < 0.02

2、 Mortality-rate between 0.02 and 0.03

3、Mortality-rate > 0.03
